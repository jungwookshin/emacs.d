EMACS configuration

$ git clone git@github.com:jungwookshin/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

$ emacs or Emacs.app from Finder

Emacs will compile due to packages are not installed. 

M-x packages-install-fromfile 

You are then prompted to accept or decline package repositories. 
I accepted them always. 

Then will install many of files.

But some packages are not installed, e.g., treemacs-all-the-icons.

Rerun emacs

Mx package-refresh-contents

based on this link: 

https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el

M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts

"brew install fontconfig" works for fc-cash

still file type and icons don't match.


For Mac, it needs to give full path access to emacs
